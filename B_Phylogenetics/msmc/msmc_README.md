# MSMC2 Pipeline - Estimating Effective Population Size
===========================================
## Script Requirements
Each script requires the base_params.sh file and params_msmc.sh file.

## General Pipeline
Estimating Effective Population Size (Ne) over time in MSMC2 should follow the outline below. All scripts will require edits to the params_msmc.sh file to function
NOTE: This workflow is a modified form of Jessi Rick's pipeline (found here: https://github.com/jessicarick/msmc2_scripts/). Her documentation is very well done and can go into more detail if you are confused.
