#dadi Development Notes

Overall Status:
The dadi scripts have been implemented into the Genomics-Main Worflow with updated scripts, parameter files, and some basic documentation.
However, now that we have gotten back to where we were with dadi in this new workflow, we still need to resolve a few lingering issues with our analysis.

Action Items:
    - Still getting GIM Uncertainty Analysis NaN values. Need to resolve this....somehow?
    - Our LowPass worflow through dadi should technically work, if our prior worflows for generating our VCFs (without ANGSD) properly format the files along with the needed coverage data. However, it is still untested.
